# Challenge 3 - Reverse a string

# Reverse a string in place. In other words, do not create a new string or use other methods on the string such as reverse.
# The goal of the problem is to use a loop and the string accessors to figure out which values to swap for other values. 
# Below is the output.

# Enter a string:
# reverse_me
# em_esrever

#1. split string into an array
#2. swap the first and last characters
#3. swap the second and second to last characters
#4. continue until we are in the middle
#5. take the array and transform into a string
